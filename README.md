# ✨ Clarity - Digital Solutions Landing Page

![Project Preview](./Images/project-preview.png)


## 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a **pixel-perfect** implementation of the "Clarity" landing page design. It focuses on mastering **Bootstrap 5** for layout and components, combined with **pure CSS** for advanced styling and animations.

The main goal was to achieve a responsive, high-quality UI **without writing a single line of custom JavaScript**, relying solely on Bootstrap's built-in functionality and CSS customization.
